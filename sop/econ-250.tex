\noindent
I'm applying Stanford to become an academic economist conducting research in applied microeconomics and political economics. Broadly, I aim to study economic opportunity, spatial inequality, and political polarization in the United States.

I graduated \emph{summa cum laude} from Carleton College with a double major in mathematics and statistics.
My math thesis reproved Dirichlet's Unit Theorem (a seminal result in algebraic number theory) and my statistics thesis applied deep learning sequence models to basketball.
I surprisingly found that these sequentially-aware neural networks provided little improvement over much simpler models, suggesting a minimal role of momentum.
I also coauthored an algorithms research paper, helped build computational infrastructure for an international physics research group, and spent two stints at the University of Minnesota as an applied cryptography RA.
Since graduating, I've worked as a predoctoral fellow for Opportunity Insights.

In an ongoing independent project that I hope to continue in graduate school, I propose a novel measure of ideological polarization that captures both disagreement on individual questions and the extent to which opinions are correlated between issues \parencite{pattison-2025-polarization}.
Soon, I plan to connect this to the large literature on affective polarization.
For example:
Does my measure correlate across place with measures of affective polarization, and if so, which appears first chronologically?
Does sensationalist media coverage cause opinions to diverge, and if so, does this divergence remain after the public discourse has moved on?

Stanford's empirical and theoretical excellence make it the ideal place to launch this agenda.
